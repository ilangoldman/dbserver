# Database Server

This is an implementation of a database service provider. This is aimed to leverage the full capacity of Docker's containers and security.

To install you just need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) in your local or remote machine. After that, execute the *setup.sh* script or copy and paste the lines bellow to have it ready for you to test.
```
git clone https://github.com/ilangoldman/dbserver.git
cd dbserver
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

In the example folder there is a demo video of how the solution works.
